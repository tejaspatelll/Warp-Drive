## Project Overview

This project simulates an interactive "warp drive" journey through deep space, rendered on a 128x128 color TFT using an ESP8266 microcontroller. Travel at warp speed, discover celestial objects, and enjoy dynamic, optimized visual effects — all in under 80KB of code!

---

## Hardware Requirements

- **ESP8266 development board** (e.g., NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini)
- **ST7735 TFT Display** (128x128 pixels)
- **Potentiometer** (for speed/wrap control)
- Jumper wires, breadboard

### Pin Connections

| Signal      | ESP8266 GPIO | NodeMCU Pin | TFT Pin   |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| TFT_CS      | GPIO5        | D1          | CS        |
| TFT_RST     | GPIO4        | D2          | RST       |
| TFT_DC      | GPIO0        | D3          | DC/A0     |
| TFT_MOSI    | GPIO13       | D7          | MOSI      |
| TFT_SCLK    | GPIO14       | D5          | SCK       |
| POT         | A0           | A0          | Potentiometer (middle pin) |

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone or Download** this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp8266-warpdrive-visualization.git
    ```

2. **Install Arduino Libraries:**
    - [ESP8266 Board support](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/)
    - [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI)
    - (Optional) Any additional libraries listed in the code’s includes

3. **Configure `TFT_eSPI`**:
   - Edit `User_Setup.h` to match the pinout above.

4. **Wire the Hardware** as per [the diagram](#wiring-diagram).

5. **Upload** using the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

## Features

- **Twinkling Starfield:** Realistic space background with shooting stars.
- **Warp Speed Effect:** Engage "warp drive" using the potentiometer.
- **Celestial Discoveries:** Encounter planets, black holes, galaxies, nebulae and more!
- **Optimized Animations:** Selective redraws and dynamic framerates for smooth visuals.
- **Visual Effects:** Particle systems, light blooms, lensing, and more!

#### Celestial Objects Include:
- Stars (twinkling)
- Planets (with atmosphere)
- Nebulae (particle systems)
- Spiral Galaxies, Solar Systems
- Asteroid Fields, Comets, Pulsars, Supernovae
- Black Holes (accretion disk, lensing, relativistic effects, spaghettification)

---

## How It Works

**State Machine:**
- **NORMAL:** Floating through starfields.
- **WARP:** Engaged when potentiometer exceeds threshold; triggers warp visuals.
- **DISCOVERY:** Exit from warp; chance to discover a new object.

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Only redraw changed screen regions and moving objects.
- Pre-allocated buffers and structs for memory efficiency.
- Dynamic framerate and SPI bus optimizations.

**Visual Pipeline:**
- Erase → Physics Update → Draw (layered: backgrounds, objects, effects)
- Special effects (e.g., gravitational lensing for black holes) layered for realism.

## Customization & Extending

### Planned Features

- Binary star systems, neutron stars, quasars, ringed planets, and space stations!
- Parallax, color filters, advanced lighting/shadows.
- Input expansion: buttons for object selection, camera controls.
- Menu systems and scanning modes.
- Wi-Fi for data sharing or downloading new discoveries.
- Sound effects, higher-res displays, battery management.
