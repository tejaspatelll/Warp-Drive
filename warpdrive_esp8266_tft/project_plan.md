# ESP8266 Warp Drive Visualization Project Plan

## Project Overview

The Warp Drive Visualization is an Arduino-based project that creates a Star Trek-inspired space exploration simulator on a small TFT display driven by an ESP8266 microcontroller. The project uses the limited hardware resources of the ESP8266 to create a rich, interactive universe exploration experience with realistic celestial objects and engaging visual effects.

## Hardware Components

- **ESP8266 based board** (NodeMCU, Wemos D1, etc.)
- **ST7735 TFT Display** (128x128 pixels)
- **Potentiometer** for warp control

### Pin Connections
- TFT_CS: GPIO5 (D1)
- TFT_RST: GPIO4 (D2)
- TFT_DC: GPIO0 (D3)
- TFT MOSI: GPIO13 (D7)
- TFT SCLK: GPIO14 (D5)
- POT_PIN: A0 (Analog input)

## Code Architecture

### State Management

The application utilizes a state machine with three primary states:

1. **NORMAL** - Displays a twinkling starfield with occasional shooting stars
2. **WARP** - Shows the iconic Star Trek warp effect when the potentiometer value exceeds a threshold
3. **DISCOVERY** - Triggered when exiting warp mode, with a chance to discover celestial objects

### Display Update Architecture

Performance optimization is critical on the resource-constrained ESP8266. The code implements several techniques to maintain smooth animation:

1. **Selective Updates**: Only the parts of the screen that change are redrawn, rather than refreshing the entire display
2. **Previous Position Tracking**: Previous coordinates are stored to allow targeted erasing of objects
3. **Batch Processing**: Updates are staggered across multiple frames to distribute processing load
4. **Dynamic Frame Timing**: Frame rates are adjusted based on the current state and complexity of the scene
5. **SPI Optimization**: SPI communication is maximized (40MHz) for faster drawing operations
6. **Task Distribution**: Different animations are updated on different frames using counters

### Memory Management

- **Static Memory Allocation**: All arrays and buffers are pre-allocated with fixed sizes to avoid heap fragmentation
- **Struct-based Data**: Organized data structures for each celestial object type to manage state efficiently
- **Constexpr Constants**: Compile-time constants to reduce runtime overhead

## Current Features
